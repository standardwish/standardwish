## üåü My Projects  

Here are some of the projects I've worked on or been involved in:  

### üöÄ Featured Projects  

- **[Project ALIVE](https://github.com/SWE-ALIVE)**    
  **_Description:_** An academia-industry collaboration software engineering project with **LG Electronics**. We developed a multi-chat system that allows users to intuitively manage a smart home through natural language conversations. I participated as a front-end developer and lead developer. I was responsible for architecture, design, and development.    
  **_Tech Stack:_** [React Native, Typescript, Python, RAG, DST]  

- **[FORIF OFFICIAL](https://github.com/forif-npo/forif-official)**  
  **_Website Link:_** You can check it out on the following [website link](https://forif.org) :)    
  **_Description:_** Initiated to address the inconveniences experienced while managing club administration through a mentor/mentee system, which relied on dispersed tools and offline methods. Features related to course registration, mentor-related tasks, and management functionalities were developed. I participated as a front-end developer and lead developer for both the main page and the admin page. I was responsible for architecture, design, and development.  
  **_Tech Stack:_** [React, Typescript]    

- **Smart Home Simulator @ HOLI Lab**  
  **_Description:_** Currently developing a smart home simulator integrated with large language models (LLMs) to evaluate their performance in multi-turn, context-aware environments. This simulator enables testing of AI agents' ability to handle complex, natural conversations with users and dynamic device states.  
  **_Tech Stack:_** [Python, React, LLM APIs]

## üìñ Publication  

### Conference Papers  
- **[B.F. Sword: Blank inference system with optimized rag and knowledge distillation](https://www.dbpia.co.kr/journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE11714611)**    
  **_Authors:_** Jun Seong Pyo, Hyejin Bae, ...    
  **_Conference:_** THE HCI SOCIETY OF KOREA    
  **_Venue:_** Gangwon-do, South Korea, February    
  **_Abstract:_** Developed an AI tool for generating English blank inference questions for Korea‚Äôs CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test) using large language models, leveraging RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), knowledge distillation techniques, and Peirce's abduction.

## üéØ Goals & Aspirations  

I am a developer striving to create a new paradigm of user experience. Rather than settling for conventional frameworks, I continuously challenge and innovate to deliver greater value to users. My current focus is on exploring how LLMs can transform smart environments into more intuitive, context-aware systems.
